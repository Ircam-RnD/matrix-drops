# Drops

*Drops* is a collaborative performance based on [*Soundworks*](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks).

## Description

The *Drops* collective smartphone performance is strongly inspired by the mobile application *Bloom* by Brian Eno and and Peter Chilvers. *Drops* reproduces several audiovisual elements of the original *Bloom* application while transposing them into a collaborative experience.

In Drops, each participant can play sounds whose pitch and timbre vary depending on the touch position. Very similar to the *Bloom* application, each sound is visualized by a circle growing from the tapping position and fading with the sound.

Together, the players can construct sound sequences (*i.e.* melodies) by combining their sounds. The sounds are repeated in a fading loop every few seconds until they vanish. Players can clear the loop by shaking their smartphones. The sounds triggered by one player are automatically echoed by the smartphones of other players. The collective performance on the smartphones is accompanied by a synchronized soundscape on ambient loudspeakers.
